### Key Takeaways
- Rollout plans. Use MVP model
- Metrics need to be REALLY specific to offer feedback (scientific)
- Velocity can only be used for capacity not delivery.
- Use metrics on what you want to change & how you know you have achieved that.

The MVP model!

### MVP Model
<em>"MVP is not making shit for lots of people"</em>
- MVP: Solve Julian's problem. Then expand the market.

Rolling out organisational change should be considered in the same vein.

### Speed Metrics ('Lets work on Speed for the next 3 months)
- Lead time for change (checked in git -> prod)
- Deployment frequency (prod or users)
- Time to restore service
- Change failure rate

### Post Mortems
- Blameless
- Whats the problem, swarm fixes.

## Complex adaptive systems
- Organisations
- Software
	- Process changes are cheaper the software solutions.
	- Adds further complexity.

Its not about "Lets do what they do and expect a result".

### Final Thoughts
- Goal based Metrics üëç
- If we want to reduce 'meetings' lets measure to see if we are.
- If we want to improve our uptime stability 'lets measure we are'.
